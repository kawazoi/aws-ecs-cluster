# ECS Cluster

This repository is the first one in our [series](../README.md).

Attention: Remember to clear all resources to avoid unnecessary costs.


## Requirements

- Python 3,7
- virtualenv
- AWS CDK
- Github Actions


## Deploy Stack locally

1. Follow the steps below

# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

This is a blank project for Python development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the .env
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```bash
cdk synth
```

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
